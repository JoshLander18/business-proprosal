            Recently the clothing industry was impacted negatively because of supply chain challenges experienced by raw material suppliers in North America due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <span style="color:rgb(217, 164, 244)">Custom Junction</span> decided it was a great opportunity to venture into sourcing soft sheer fabrics from regional suppliers to address the need for a specific type of custom-made shirt that is more appropriate for our tropical climate.  
            From research conducted we recognized that Guyana was open, and not locked down like its neighbors. After approaching Guyana the fabric makers were willing to supply our company with Muslin, and other cotton based fabrics for our custom-made shirts. The trade agreement was drawn up to lock Guyana and <span style="color:rgb(217, 164, 244)">Custom Junction</span> into a 5-year trade agreement, to not supply any of our competitors with those select types of fabrics.  Our competitors at the time were selling t-shirts made of thick jersey fabric.
